question: "What technology stacks is picoflow buit on?"
answer: "The PicoFlow Agentic Framework is currently available in JavaScript, chosen to align with the large and established microservices developer ecosystem. By integrating directly with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com), we enable Node.js developers to rapidly create production-ready Agentic endpoints with minimal friction. We expect a future Python version will be available."
